## Assignment - Application Development

We need to plan out the marketplace app that you worked on in the previous Technical Interview and build a small proof of concept. We have some sample data which can be found in `products.json`, to use as a starting point.

### MVP Proof of Concept

Your requirements for this proof of concept:

1. Create a list page, which contains a list of the products sorted by date modified, and id.
2. Create a detail page, which shows more details about the the specific product.
3. Allow users to add new products or edit an existing product.
4. If you choose not to use json file as the database, you must write a script or data migration to import the data into your database of choice.
5. EXTRA: Use the users list to allow a "log in as" feature to record product "views".
6. EXTRA: Recommend users to other products based on what their friends have "viewed". You may add additional dummy data to illustrate this functionality.

You are strongly recommended to complete steps 5 and 6 if time allows.

### How to submit your work:

Provide all necessary links to your project plan files, and either include your app in replit or in a public github repository link.

### How you will be evaluated:

This assignment will be evaluated based on structure, functionality, and user experience.
